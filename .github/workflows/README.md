# GitHub Project Automation

If you'd like to automate card creation from GitHub issues and pull requests for this repository using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions), you can create your own workflow `.yml` file with your name in this folder.

The easiest way to get started is to copy one of the existing files in this folder and replace your name/username throughout the file. Depending on your specific project layout, you may also want to check that the column names are correct.

This workflow uses the [GitHub Project Automation+](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-project-automation) Action in order to create the cards in the specified project and column.
